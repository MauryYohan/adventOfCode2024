# Day 4: Ceres Search

"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the Ceres monitoring station!

As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.

This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with '.'

Example :
MMMSXXMASM                      ....XXMAS.      1
MSAMXMSMSA                      .SAMXMS...      1
AMXSXMAAMM                      ...S..A...      0
MSAMASMSMX                      ..A.A.MS.X      0
XMASAMXAMM                      XMASAMX.MM      2
XXAMMXXAMA                      X.....XA.A      0
SMSMSASXSS                      S.S.S.S.SS      0
SAXAMASAAA                      .A.A.A.A.A      0
MAMMMXMMMM                      ..M.M.M.MM      0
MXMXAXMASX                      .X.X.XMASX      1
